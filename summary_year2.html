      <section>
        <p>A short summary of activities to date (no more than two pages, you might like to articulate this as part of a slide presentation), focusing in particular on the period since your last review.  Discuss to what extent you met your plan for the year.

        <p>Topics might include: a statement about your research topic or question; what research activities you have undertaken; a list of any publications and presentations (internal or external) that you may have been involved with; any courses and training that you have engaged with.
        <aside class="notes">
		Oh hey, these are some notes. They'll be hidden in your presentation, but you can see them if you open the speaker notes window (hit »S« on your keyboard).

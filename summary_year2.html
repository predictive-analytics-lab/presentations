      <section>
        <p>A short summary of activities to date (no more than two pages, you might like to articulate this as part of a slide presentation), focusing in particular on the period since your last review.  Discuss to what extent you met your plan for the year.

        <p>Topics might include: a statement about your research topic or question; what research activities you have undertaken; a list of any publications and presentations (internal or external) that you may have been involved with; any courses and training that you have engaged with.
        <aside class="notes">
		Oh hey, these are some notes. They'll be hidden in your presentation, but you can see them if you open the speaker notes window (hit »S« on your keyboard).

          <li>Learning about Gaussian Processes and algorithmic fairness
          <li>Paper on how to enforce fairness with Gaussian Process models
            (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05598v1">arxiv.org/abs/1810.05598v1</a>)
            <ul>

          <li>Improving the paper
          <li>Literature review
          <li>Progression Review for year 1
        </ul>

        <aside class="notes">
          In my first year, I worked on a paper on Algorithmic Fairness in Gaussian Process models.
          Then submitted it to NIPS (now called NeurIPS) where it was rejected.
          Already while waiting for the reviews from NIPS, I was working on improvements to the method.

        <h2>Workshop paper</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Submitted shortened version of the FairGP paper (4 pages) submitted to NeurIPS workshop WESGAI
            <ul>
              <li>WESGAI: Workshop on Ethical, Social and Governance Issues in AI,
                <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/aiethicsworkshop/accepted-papers">List of accepted papers</a>
              <li>Paper was accepted
            </ul>
          <li>Attended NeurIPS 2018 and presented the paper in a poster presentation
        </ul>

      <section>
        <h2>Improved conference paper</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Extended the FairGP paper to also work with logistic regression and simplified the explanation
            (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05598v3">arxiv.org/abs/1810.05598v3</a>)
          <li>Submitted to ICML in January and to ECML in April, twice rejected
          <li>Shortly after submitting to ECML, had an idea how to improve it
            <ul>
              <li>Add proof about how much the accuracy necessarily suffers when enforcing fairness
              <li>Plan to re-submit to AAAI
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <aside class="notes">
          The ECML submission contained small tweaks compared to the ICML submission.
          There were always some reviewers who wanted to accept it.
